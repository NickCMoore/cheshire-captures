## Overview

**Cheshire Captures** is a full-stack photography community platform designed to connect photographers and photo enthusiasts. Built using Django REST Framework and React, it allows users to create accounts, upload photos, rate, comment, and interact with the photography community. Users can filter photos by category, search for photographers or photos, and view top-rated content.

Both the backend and frontend are deployed separately on Heroku, with the backend providing a robust API for data management and the frontend delivering an intuitive and responsive user experience.
